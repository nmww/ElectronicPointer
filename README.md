电子教鞭是一款基于Python开发的开源程序，主要用于直播录课和屏幕标注。它可以让教师在授课过程中方便地进行屏幕标注，并且支持视频录制和直播功能，使得学生可以随时回顾课程内容。

同时，电子教鞭也非常易于使用，用户只需要下载并安装程序，在打开软件后，会显示一个透明的画板，可以在上面进行各种标注操作。程序支持多种不同的笔刷、颜色和形状，用户可以根据自己的需求进行选择。此外，还支持撤销、重做、清空等常见操作，使得用户能够快速地完成各种标注任务。

除了屏幕标注功能之外，电子教鞭还支持视频录制和直播功能。这使得教师可以在授课过程中使用电子教鞭进行标注，并实时将标注内容传输给学生。如果学生无法参加课堂，也可以通过录制功能进行后续观看。

总的来说，电子教鞭是一款非常实用的教育工具，可以方便教师进行课堂教学，并为学生提供更好的学习体验。如果您对这个项目感兴趣，可以前往官方网站或开源代码仓库了解更多信息。

Electronic Chalk is a Python-based open-source program designed for live streaming and screen annotation. It allows teachers to easily annotate their screens during class, and supports video recording and live streaming functions, allowing students to review the course content at any time.

Moreover, Electronic Chalk is very easy to use. Users just need to download and install the program, and upon opening the software, an transparent board will be displayed where various annotation operations can be performed. The program supports multiple brushes, colors, and shapes, so users can choose according to their needs. In addition, it also supports common operations such as undo, redo, clear, etc., making it easy for users to complete various annotation tasks.

In addition to screen annotation, Electronic Chalk also supports video recording and live streaming functions. This enables teachers to annotate during the lecture and transmit the annotated content to students in real-time. If students cannot attend the class, they can also watch the recorded lectures afterwards.

Overall, Electronic Chalk is a very useful educational tool that makes classroom teaching easier for teachers and provides a better learning experience for students. If you are interested in this project, you can visit the official website or open source code repository to learn more information.
